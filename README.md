# **Twitter Sentiment Analysis Group Project**

## Overview
This project aims to build NLP models that can predict the sentiment of tweets for Apple and Google products as either positive, negative or neutral.

The NLP base model will be a binary classifier focusing on the positive and negative reviews and will expand into a multiclass classifier capturing neutral sentiment reviews.

This will aid the companies in collection of reviews for their products and build or improve said products from the reviews.
### **Business Problem and Stakeholders**
Marketing and Branding teams at technology companies such as Apple and Google rely heavily on public feedback to shape brand strategies. Social media platforms such as twitter provide a large source of customer feedback that is difficult to analyze manually due to the nature of tweets(text). The business problem for this project is the need for a system that can accurately classify the sentiment of tweets towards the products as positive, negative or neutral.  
By automatically identifying changes in public sentiments, marketing brands and teams can track brand perception and respond more quickly to customer feedback. The model will support data-driven branding decisions by transforming raw tweets into actionable sentiment insights.
