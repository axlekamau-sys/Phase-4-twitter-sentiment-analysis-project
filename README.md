# **Twitter Sentiment Analysis Group Project**

## Overview
This project aims to build NLP models that can predict the sentiment of tweets for Apple and Google products as either positive, negative or neutral.

The NLP base model will be a binary classifier focusing on the positive and negative reviews and will expand into a multiclass classifier capturing neutral sentiment reviews.

This will aid the companies in collection of reviews for their products and build or improve said products from the reviews.
